[00:06.10] I kinda wanna throw my phone across the room
[00:09.57] 'Cause all I see are girls too good to be true
[00:12.40] With paper-white teeth and perfect bodies
[00:15.49] Wish I didn't care
[00:24.49] 
[00:16.96] I know their beauty's not my lack
[00:21.98] But it feels like that weight is on my back
[00:27.77] And I can't let it go
[00:38.27] 
[00:29.52] Co-comparison is killing me slowly
[00:35.02] I think, I think too much
[00:37.97] 'Bout kids who don't know me
[00:41.26] I'm so sick of myself
[00:44.04] I'd rather be, rather be
[00:47.06] Anyone, anyone else
[00:49.81] My jealousy, jealousy
[00:51.86] Started following me (he-he-he, he-he)
[00:57.48] Started following me (he-he-he, he-he)
[01:16.48] 
[01:04.36] And I see everyone getting all the things I want
[01:08.05] And I'm happy for them, but then again, I'm not
[01:11.03] Just cool vintage clothes and vacation photos
[01:13.74] I can't stand it, oh, God, I sound crazy
[01:33.74] 
[01:16.10] Their win is not my loss
[01:20.68] I know it's true
[01:21.85] But I can't help getting caught up in it all
[01:43.85] 
[01:27.69] Co-co-comparison is killing me slowly
[01:33.63] I think, I think too much
[01:36.48] 'Bout kids who don't know me
[01:39.61] I'm so sick of myself
[01:42.56] I'd rather be, rather be
[01:45.65] Anyone, anyone else
[01:48.36] My jealousy, jealousy (yeah)
[02:02.36] 
[01:51.12] All your friends are so cool, you go out every night
[01:54.05] In your daddy's nice car, yeah, you're living the life
[01:57.03] Got a pretty face, a pretty boyfriend too
[01:59.82] I wanna be you so bad, and I don't even know you
[02:03.14] All I see is what I should be
[02:06.00] Happier, prettier, jealousy, jealousy
[02:08.91] All I see is what I should be
[02:11.62] I'm losing it, all I get's, jealousy, jealousy
[02:34.62] 
[02:14.82] Co-comparison is killing me slowly
[02:20.43] I think, I think too much
[02:23.29] 'Bout kids who don't know me
[02:26.58] And I'm so sick of myself
[02:29.38] I'd rather be, rather be (oh, oh)
[02:32.45] Anyone, anyone else (anybody else)
[02:35.30] Jealousy, jealousy
[02:44.30] 
[02:37.53] Oh, I'm so sick of myself
[02:41.04] I'd rather be, rather be (oh-oh)
[02:44.26] Anyone, anyone else
[02:47.09] Jealousy, jealousy
[02:48.78] Started following me
